                    Unimed is a cooperative created with the aim of providing a dignified medical care alternative for the Brazilian population, in addition to creating a work system that values ​​the commitment of professionals and is exclusively focused on customer satisfaction. With this objective, the cooperative system was adopted.<br>
                    <br>
                    In December 1967, in Santos (SP), the first Unimed was born. And with it came the Medical Work Cooperative, an unprecedented modality in Brazil and the world. At the time, during the military dictatorship, the attitude of those 30 pioneering doctors was bold and courageous, as it highlighted the problems of the public health system (INPS) and stood up to group medicine companies, which worked for profit, not for health.<br>
                    <br>
                    Using an administration model in which doctors themselves manage the services provided, without intermediaries, the population soon realized the advantages and quality of care, starting to legitimize Unimed and providing conditions for the system to develop in other cities.<br>
                    <br>
                    From then on, within a few months, several Unimeds were opened and, 10 years after the first cooperative, there are already 60 across the country. Federations and Confederations also emerge, to standardize operational procedures and encourage the exchange of experiences between Unimeds.<br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, Unimed is the largest healthcare operator in Latin America, present throughout the national territory, dividing its operations between the Unimed National Cooperative Alliance and Unimed do Brasil.<br>
                    <br>
                    Unimed Registro, founded on 06/29/1980, began its activities with 44 cooperating doctors who appear in the minutes of its foundation, thus beginning this cooperative with a promising future.<br>
                    <br>
                    Dr. Alexander Kutassy assumed the presidency and collaborated in taking the first steps towards the success of the medical cooperative, with a basic initial purpose of investing in the quality of the city's professionals and expanding the range of health options among all layers of the population, idea that prevails intact to this day.<br>
